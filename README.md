## Project Synopsis
This is a **personal project** focused on data analysis (Data Preparation, Understanding & Feature Engineering) and data visualization. The goal of this project is to help optimize merchant sales and revenue in E-Commerce by analyzing consumer behavior based on the data. The tools used to carry out the analysis are Python (Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn & Matplotlib) and also Tableau to create interactive dashboards.

## Objective & Motivation
According to the ***US Census Bureau***, E-Commerce sales have experienced a **positive trend** over the last decade, and also according to the ***Statista Research Department***, it is estimated that revenue from sales in e-commerce will continue to **increase even in the next 5 years** (2028).

Therefore, it is very interesting to research further how we as E-Commerce merchants can **optimize sales** and **income** by analyzing **consumer behavior to find the right sales strategy**.
